# SVMKit Examples

This repository will be acting as a central repository for examples of how to use [svmkit](https://github.com/abklabs/svmkit?tab=readme-ov-file#svmkit) to build simple and complex Solana installations, easily.  Until this repository is further populated, please have a look at:

- [svmkit](https://github.com/abklabs/svmkit?tab=readme-ov-file#svmkit) - Our deployment-agnostic tooling for building Solana validators and SPEs.
- [pulumi-svmkit](https://github.com/abklabs/pulumi-svmkit?tab=readme-ov-file#pulumi-svmkit) - A Pulumi provider built around svmkit.
